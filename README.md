## ‚ú® AI-Driven Development & Vibe Coding

This project serves as a testament to the potential of AI-assisted development, often referred to as "vibe coding". Approximately **99% of the code was generated by AI assistants**, primarily Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with human intervention focused on debugging complex issues, guiding the AI, and refining the overall architecture.

The development process heavily utilized AI tools and specific methodologies:

1.  **Cursor Memory Bank:** The core control mechanism for AI development. It was used for:

    - **Planning & Tracking:** Defining features, breaking down tasks (`tasks.md`), and tracking progress (`progress.md`).
    - **Context Management:** Providing relevant technical context (`techContext.md`), system patterns (`systemPatterns.md`), and product goals (`productContext.md`) to the AI. See the `/memory-bank` directory for details.
    - **Mode-Based Development:** Switching between different operational modes (VAN for initialization, PLAN for structuring work, BUILD for code generation, CREATIVE for complex problem-solving/debugging) to guide the AI's behavior effectively.

2.  **Model Context Protocols (MCPs):** Specific AI agents invoked via defined protocols for targeted tasks:

    - **Supabase MCP:** Used for direct interaction with the Supabase backend, including schema modifications, data querying, and managing database objects.
    - **Browser Tools MCP:** Facilitated automated communication and interaction with a web browser for tasks potentially requiring frontend simulation or interaction (though less used in this specific backend/component focused phase).

3.  **Model Selection Strategy:** Different AI models were chosen based on task requirements:

    - **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Leveraged for large feature development due to its extensive context window and strong generation capabilities.
    - **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Utilized primarily for debugging and refinement tasks due to its tight integration within the Cursor IDE and strong analytical abilities.

4.  **Lovable.dev:** Employed initially to generate a foundational, aesthetically pleasing UI template, providing a quick start for the frontend structure.

5.  **AI-Powered Features:** Beyond development assistance, AI was integrated into core product features:
    - **AI Profile Summarization:** An Edge Function uses OpenAI to generate concise summaries of job applicants for employers.
    - **AI Candidate Matching:** (Partially via Power Match) SQL functions and backend logic perform skill-based matching between candidates and jobs.

This project highlights the potential of AI to accelerate development significantly. The process has been a valuable learning experience, paving the way for faster, cleaner, and more sophisticated AI-driven projects in the future.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Authentication:** Secure signup/login for Job Seekers & Employers (Supabase Auth).
- **Profile Management:** Comprehensive profiles with skills, experience, education, company details, benefits editing.
- **Job Lifecycle:** Post, search, view, edit, and apply for jobs.
- **AI Summaries:** Employers can get AI-generated summaries of applicants (OpenAI via Edge Function).
- **Power Matching:** Automated job-to-candidate and candidate-to-job matching based on skills and criteria.
- **Invitations:** Employers can directly invite matched candidates to apply.
- **Application Tracking:** View application status and manage stages.
- **Dashboards:** At-a-glance overview with key statistics for both user types.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions & Stack

### Core Decisions

1.  **Supabase Platform:** Chosen as the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for its integrated features (Auth, Postgres DB, Edge Functions), simplifying backend development.
2.  **React & Next.js + Vite:** Standard, performant frontend framework for building modern web applications.
3.  **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
4.  **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui:** Utility-first styling and a pre-built component library enable rapid, consistent, and accessible UI development.
5.  **Edge Functions:** Used for server-side logic requiring external API calls (OpenAI) or complex database operations (Power Match automation), keeping logic close to the data.

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React & Next.js (with Vite)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication, Postgres Database, Edge Functions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase Account & Project Created
- (Optional but Recommended) Supabase CLI installed ([Installation Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd match-matrix
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key (found in your Supabase Project Settings > API).
    - Add any other required keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY` if testing AI features locally).

    ```dotenv
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key (if needed locally)
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**

    - **Using Supabase CLI (Recommended):**

      1.  Log in: `supabase login`
      2.  Link project: `supabase link --project-ref <your-project-id>`
      3.  Apply migrations to remote DB: `supabase migration up`
          _(This applies pending migrations from `src/db/migrations` sequentially)._

    - **Manual Setup (Supabase UI - Use with caution):**
      1.  Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase Dashboard.
      2.  Copy and run the content of **each** `.sql` file from `src/db/migrations/` **sequentially, in numerical order** (01, 02, 03,... 29). Failure to run in order **will** cause errors.

5.  **Run Locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified port).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

- **Automatic:** Pushes to the `main` branch trigger automatic deployments.
- **Manual:** Can be deployed via the Vercel dashboard.
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc., are set in the Vercel project settings.
