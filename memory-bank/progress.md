## 2023-08-16

- **Debug/Fix:** Resolved issue where the "Find Matches Now" button in `PowerMatchesSection.tsx` was not generating `power_matches` entries despite the underlying RPC call succeeding.
  - **Diagnosis:** The RPC call `trigger_user_power_match` was executed successfully (returning `status: 'success'`) but reported finding 0 new matches.
  - **Root Cause:** The function ran as the authenticated user (`SECURITY INVOKER`), but the RLS policies on `power_matches` were missing an `INSERT` policy for the user. The function could read jobs but couldn't write the results.
  - **Fix:** Created migration `22_fix_power_match_rls.sql` to add the following policy:
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY insert_own_power_matches ON public.power_matches
        FOR INSERT
        WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    ```
  - **Verification:** Confirmed the button now generates power matches correctly when called from the frontend.

## 2023-08-17

- **Implementation:** Added backend core functions for Pro Job Seeker features to `src/lib/database.ts`:
  - Added TypeScript types: `AssessmentSkill`, `PowerMatch`.

  - Marked corresponding tasks in `tasks.md` as complete.
  - Next steps: Implement automation functions (Edge Functions or SQL) for power match generation and management.

## 2023-08-18

- **Implementation:** Created SQL function `find_eligible_power_match_jobs` in migration file `18_add_pro_automation_functions.sql`:
  - The function takes a user ID and limit, calculates match scores for open jobs.
  - Filters jobs with score > 80, excluding those already applied to or in power matches.
  - Returns the top N matching job IDs and scores.
  - Marked corresponding task in `tasks.md` as complete.
  - Next steps: Create the `generate-power-matches` Edge Function.

  - Included authorization check and error handling/logging.
  - Noted: Local linter errors persist due to Deno environment differences.
  - Marked corresponding tasks in `tasks.md` as complete.
  - Next steps: Create the `check-power-match-views` Edge Function.

## 2023-08-21

- **Implementation:** Created `check-power-match-views` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/check-power-match-views/index.ts`):
  - Added logic to find power matches applied more than 2 days ago but not viewed.
  - Implemented logic to update the corresponding application status to 'inactive' and stage to 'Withdrawn'.
  - Included authorization check and error handling/logging.
  - Noted: Local linter errors persist due to Deno environment differences.

## 2023-08-25

- **Refactor:** Modified the "Find Matches Now" functionality (`trigger_user_power_match` SQL function) to immediately auto-apply to newly found matches.
  - **Reason:** User requirement changed from separate find/apply steps to a single atomic operation for the manual trigger.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Created migration `23_modify_trigger_user_power_match_to_autoapply.sql`.
    - Updated `trigger_user_power_match` SQL function to:
      - Loop through eligible jobs found by `find_eligible_power_match_jobs`.
      - Insert into `power_matches`.
      - Insert into `applications` (status/stage 'Applied').
      - Update `power_matches` with the `application_id` and `applied_at` timestamp.
      - Use sub-transactions (`BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END`) to handle errors per-job.
      - Return count of _applications created_ (renamed field to `new_matches_applied`).
    - Updated `TriggerPowerMatchResult` type in `database.ts`.
    - Updated toast notification in `PowerMatchesSection.tsx` to reflect immediate application.
  - **Note:** The separate `auto-apply-power-matches` Edge Function is still needed for periodic checks, but the manual button now provides immediate application.
  - **Addendum:** Added `SECURITY DEFINER` to `trigger_user_power_match` function (in migration 23) to resolve RLS issues preventing application insertion when called via RPC by the user.

## 2023-08-26

- **UI/Bug Fix:** Addressed issues with the `PowerMatchCard` display.
  - **Fix:** Corrected the Supabase select query in `getPowerMatches` (`database.ts`) to properly fetch the nested `employer_profile.company_name`.
  - **UI:** Added a "Viewed" badge (with `Eye` icon) to `PowerMatchCard.tsx` to indicate when `viewed_at` is set.
  - **UI:** Updated the description text in `PowerMatchesSection.tsx` to clarify the auto-withdrawal condition.
