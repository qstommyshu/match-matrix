# Active Context - Match Matrix

## Current Development Focus

- Testing and refinement of Pro Job Seeker features (including enhancements).
- Verifying Assessment Skill Expiration display logic.
- Testing Manual Power Match Trigger functionality and feedback.
- Planning for remaining tasks (payment, assessment creation).

## Technical Challenges

- Ensuring correct date calculations and timezone handling for expiration.
- Verifying the manual trigger RPC function handles edge cases (e.g., user becomes inactive).
- Comprehensive testing of interactions between frontend and backend components.

## Next Tasks

1. Test Assessment Skill Expiration display (UI and logic).
2. Test Manual Power Match Trigger (button state, RPC call, feedback, list refresh).
3. Perform end-to-end testing of the core Pro feature flow.
4. Write unit tests for new backend functions (`trigger_user_power_match` RPC, helper function).
5. Plan implementation for payment integration and assessment creation flow.

## Current Status

- Pro Job Seeker feature implementation (Backend & Frontend UI) including planned enhancements is complete.
  - Database schema updated and migrated (including manual trigger RPC).
  - Backend core & helper functions implemented.
  - Backend automation logic created (SQL functions, Edge Functions - requires scheduling).
  - Frontend UI components created and integrated:
    - Upgrade banner/modal
    - Daily check-in modal/reminders
    - Assessment skills modal (with expiration display)
    - Power match section/cards (with manual trigger button)
- **Pending:** Scheduling of automation tasks, payment integration, assessment creation flow, and comprehensive testing.
- Ready to begin testing phase for all Pro features.
